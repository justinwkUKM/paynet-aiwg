        "This cell imports necessary libraries for the advanced security agent, including modules for regular expressions (`re`), IP address manipulation (`ipaddress`), date and time handling (`datetime`), CSV processing (`csv`), JSON handling (`json`), and UUID generation (`uuid`). It also defines helper functions for classifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), getting the current time in ISO format, and calculating the number of days between two dates. Policy lists (allowlist and blocklist) are initialized, and a helper to load these lists from files is defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- `import os, re, ipaddress, datetime, csv, json, uuid`: Imports various standard Python libraries.\n",
        "- `from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Iterable`: Imports type hints for better code readability and maintainability.\n",
        "- `from dotenv import load_dotenv`: Imported but not strictly necessary due to Colab secrets.\n",
        "- `from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent`: Imports the function to create the React agent.\n",
        "- `from langchain_litellm import ChatLiteLLM`: Imports the LiteLLM integration for Langchain.\n",
        "- `from langchain_core.tools import tool`: Imports the `@tool` decorator to define tools for the agent.\n",
        "- `from langgraph.config import get_stream_writer`: Imports a function related to streaming output in Langgraph.\n",
        "- `IOC_REGEX`: A dictionary containing regular expressions for different types of Indicators of Compromise (IP, domain, URL, SHA256).\n",
        "- `classify_ioc(x: str) -> str`: A helper function that takes a string and uses the `IOC_REGEX` to determine its type (ip, domain, url, sha256, or unknown).\n",
        "- `now_iso() -> str`: A helper function to get the current UTC time in ISO 8601 format.\n",

        "### Define Security Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "This cell defines a suite of tools that the advanced security agent can use. These tools are designed to perform actions relevant to security analysis, such as normalizing IOCs, performing WHOIS lookups, getting GeoIP information, checking OTX reputation, submitting URLs to urlscan.io, checking against policy lists, fusing findings into a verdict, and exporting results to CSV and STIX 2.1 formats. Note that many of these tools are implemented as mocks, returning hardcoded or simplified results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- `@tool`: The decorator is used before each function to register it as a tool.\n",
        "- `normalize_iocs(iocs: List[str]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]`: Cleans, normalizes, and deduplicates a list of input IOC strings, returning them categorized by type.\n",
        "- `whois_lookup(domain: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Performs a mock WHOIS lookup for a given domain.\n",
        "- `geoip(ip: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Performs a mock GeoIP lookup for an IPv4 address, including a bogon check.\n",
        "- `otx_reputation(ioc: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Performs a mock AlienVault OTX reputation check for an IOC.\n",
        "- `urlscan_submit(url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Submits a URL to urlscan.io (mock implementation), returning mock scan results including malicious signals.\n",
        "- `policy_check(ioc: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Checks an IOC against the hardcoded `ALLOWLIST` and `BLOCKLIST`.\n",
        "- `MITRE_MAP`: A dictionary mapping malicious signals to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.\n",
        "- `map_signals_to_mitre(signals: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]`: Maps a list of signals to corresponding MITRE techniques.\n",
        "- `verdict_fuser(findings: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Takes findings from other tools and fuses them into a final verdict with a label (Malicious, Suspicious, Benign), score (0-100), confidence (low, medium, high), evidence, policy flags, and MITRE tags. This uses a simple heuristic for scoring and confidence.\n",
        "- `export_csv(records: List[Dict[str, Any]], path: str = \"triage_results.csv\") -> Dict[str, Any]`: Exports a list of triage records to a CSV file.\n",
        "- `_stix_now()` and `_stix_id(obj_type: str)`: Helper functions for generating STIX 2.1 timestamps and IDs.\n",
        "- `export_stix2(records: List[Dict[str, Any]], path: str = \"triage_results_stix2.json\") -> Dict[str, Any]`: Exports a list of triage records to a minimal STIX 2.1 Bundle containing indicator SDOs.\n",
        "- `batch_from_csv(path: str, column: str = \"indicator\") -> Dict[str, Any]`: Reads indicators from a specified column in a CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Guidance:**\n",
        "- These tools represent the capabilities of the security agent. In a real-world scenario, these mock implementations would be replaced with actual API calls to security intelligence platforms and tools.\n",
        "- The `verdict_fuser` demonstrates how to combine information from multiple sources to arrive at a conclusion."

It outlines a detailed workflow for the agent to follow when processing user input, including normalizing IOCs, running various checks based on IOC type, fusing findings into a verdict, and exporting results if requested. Finally, it builds the React agent using the defined model, tools, and system prompt. Example functions for running single and batch demos are also included.\n",
